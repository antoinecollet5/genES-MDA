Estimation of hydraulic conductivity in a 3D aquifer using pumping test data

Problem Description
-------------------
This example demonstrates the use of genES-MDA to estimate the hydraulic conductivity of a three-dimensional heterogeneous unconfined aquifer from synthetic pumping test data. 
The forward model for groundwater flow is MODFLOW 2005. 


Dependencies
------------
All required packages and their versions are listed in requirements.txt.

To install the required packages, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt

**Note:** No installation is required for MODFLOW 2005 as the executable file (`mf2005dbl.exe`) is already provided within the `Model` subfolder of this example.


Execution
---------
To execute the application example, the Python command ES_MDA should be run using the default settings.
