Examples contains the following case study applications:

	Case1	: solution of the reverse flow routing problem for the estimation of the inflow hydrograph to a river reach based on observed water levels in a downstream section.

	Case2	: estimation of a hydraulic conductivity field using piezometric observations.
		  
	Case3	: identification of the release history of contaminant spills in an aquifer based on observed concentration data.

Results and further information for all examples are presented in the following paper:
